Demand Prediction Analysis

About Company: Comany xyz is at the forefront of micro-mobility services in India, pioneering unique vehicles designed to transform the daily commute. 
Rooted in a mission to alleviate traffic congestion across the country, it provides a reliable and safe commuting solution through an intuitive mobile app. 
The platform facilitates shared, solo, and sustainable commuting options. Strategically placed zones, spanning metro stations, bus stands, office spaces, 
residential areas, and corporate offices, aim to streamline the first and last miles of every journeyâ€”making commuting smooth, affordable, and convenient.

Project Overview
The company has faced recent challenges, experiencing notable declines in its revenue. In response, the company has engaged a consulting firm to investigate the 
factors influencing the demand for their shared electric cycles in the Indian market. The primary objectives are:
1. Identification of Significant Variables: Determine which variables play a crucial role in predicting the demand for shared electric cycles in the Indian market.
2. Understanding Variable Impact: Evaluate how well these identified variables describe and impact the demand for electric cycles.

Problem Statement - The central questions driving this analysis are:

1. Which Variables are Significant in Predicting Demand?
* Uncover the key factors that significantly contribute to the demand for shared electric cycles in the Indian market.
2. How Well Do These Variables Describe Demand?
* Assess the predictive power and effectiveness of the identified variables in explaining the fluctuations in demand for shared electric cycles.

Methodology
1. Data Cleaning: Remove null values, and handle missing data through imputation where applicable. Convert relevant object types into appropriate data types,
   such as changing object types to datetime.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct a thorough exploration of the collected data using Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization.
Identify patterns, outliers, and potential correlations between variables.
3. Statistical Analysis: Utilize hypothesis testing to validate assumptions and draw conclusions about the relationships between variables. Test hypotheses
   related to the significance of certain factors in predicting demand.
4. Visualization and Analysis: Use Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization to enhance the interpretability of trends and patterns.
